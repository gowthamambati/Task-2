OAuth is an open-standard authorization framework that provides applications the ability for “secure designated access”. 
For example, you can tell Facebook that it’s OK for ESPN.com to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having 
to give ESPN your Facebook password. This minimizes risk in a major way: In the event ESPN suffers a breach, 
your Facebook password remains safe.

OAuth doesn’t share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers. 
OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving 
away your password.


OAuth Examples

Facebook apps are a good OAuth use case example. Say you’re using an app on Facebook, and it asks you to share your profile and pictures. 
Facebook is, in this case, the service provider: it has your login data and your pictures. The app is the consumer, and as the user, 
you want to use the app to do something with your pictures. You specifically gave this app access to your pictures, 
which OAuth is managing in the background.
